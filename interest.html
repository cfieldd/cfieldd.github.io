									<h1>Interest In IT</h1>
								</header>
								<p><b>What is your interest in IT?</b> <br />I am interested in IT, specifically in programming because I'd like to be able to create applications and websites based on ideas of my own. I also find it interesting through the thought processes behind things, such as decision making through if statements etc. in order to create programs that have multiple outcomes.</p>
								<p><b>When did your interest in IT start?</b><br />My interest in IT started in early high school when I used to play games with my friends. While spending time in class we also had fun making text based adventure games in notepad. This sparked my creative side and allowed me to create interesting things of my own that I was able to produce from my imagination. I have always been interested in IT however, since I was much younger I have grown up around computers and technology so it has become a part of everyday life.</p>
								<p><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</b><br />As answered in the question above what really sparked my interest enough to pursue a degree in IT was programming or coding and the ability to be able to tell a computer to do something or go through a set of instructions that you set yourself. Specifically beginning in early High School with my friends.<br />As I've spent my whole life surrounded by computers I guess I have experienced many things in the IT industry, being very experienced with Microsoft Office, as well as recently programming in Java, Javascript, VB.NET, Python. Also experienced in both Windows and OSX operating systems.<br/>As I've spent my whole life surrounded by computers I guess I have experienced many things in the IT industry, being very experienced with Microsoft Office, as well as recently programming in Java, Javascript, VB.NET, Python.

								<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br/>I chose to come to RMIT to study as I had heard from previous graduated that it was a good university for IT in particular and after coming to the open day last year I was convinced. I also find it very easy to travel to.</p>
								<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br/> I expect to learn enough during my studies to be able to confidently work in the IT industry and to gain enough experience to work in a decent job where my skills will allow me to create my own programs as well. This will include being able to confidently code in a language, as well as use databases and storage systems confidently as well.</p>
