									<h2>SHSS - Safe Home Security System</h2>
									<p><b>Overview</b></p>
									<p>The project titled SHSS – Safe Home Security System will be a mobile application that wirelessly links to already setup home security systems and allows the user to be able to portably access the systems via their mobile device. This app will allow the users to lock and unlock doors, view their security footage and confirm or deny when alarms are set off and alerts are sent to the Police or local security company.</p>
									<p><b>Motivation</b></p>
									<p>This project is being made with the intended purpose to improve home security by the means of portability and ease of access. Instead of the users having to manually view footage on televisions and manually lock doors they are able to keep a mobile phone with them at all times. Such as a break in happening in the middle of the night while the user is asleep, the user can easily check their phone or view an alert appearing on the device close to them at the time of the break in.</p>
									<p>This project was also made to decrease the amount of break ins in Australia, as according to Budget Directs statistics there have been 225,900 recorded burglaries in Australia in 2017, where improved home security was found to be 33% of the reason that home burglaries decreased.</p>
									<p></p>
									<p><b>Description</b></p>
									<p><u>Opening Menu</u></p>
									<p>The opening menu of the application will require either touch ID, or a username and password to access the house controls.</p>
									<p>Once this is entered correctly a menu displaying the house name entered by the user, as some may control multiple locations from the same device.</p>
									<p><u>Main Menu</u></p>
									<p>This menu contains buttons titled “Security Cameras”, “Electronic Doors”, and “Alarm Systems”. When one of those buttons is pressed it will bring up the available options for each specific menu.</p>
									<p><u>Security Camera Setting</u></p>
									<p>After purchasing and setting up your security cameras, once connected to your home network will be able to be setup through the SHSS application. When opening the application there will be a button to search and pair with the security cameras on the network. After connections have been made the button to view the live footage of the cameras will be active. If there are multiple security cameras, they can be viewed by tapping left or right on the screen. </p>
									<p>A separate menu will be used for old camera footage to be viewed, saved, deleted and shared. This footage will be viewable via timestamps and days, an automatic deletion of old footage can be created, specified by a date. This is all saved in an external database on a server so that the information is secure.</p>
									<p><u>Electronic Door Lock</u></p>
									<p>Electronic door locks that are connected to your network will also be able to be connected through the applications searching under the door menu. Once the lock system is connected, you will be able to unlock and lock the doors through buttons on the screen that have the label of the door as well as whether the door is unlocked or locked.</p>
									<p><u>Alarm settings</u></p>
									<p>Through the alarm menu of the app the user will be able to select the connection setting in order to connect to their currently active alarm system. Once connected the app will alarm the users phone when the alarm system is triggered as well as send a confirmation message in case it was triggered accidentally, if the message is confirmed it will send an alert to the Police or local security company.</p>
									<p><b>Tools and Technologies</b></p>
									<p>The software required for this is the application itself on either an iOS device or android operating systems. The hardware required for this is specific security related hardware that allows for wireless connection including cameras, electronic door locks and alarm systems, as well as at least 1 mobile smart device.</p>
									<p><b>Skills Required</b></p>
									<p>If you do not have internet at the location for your security system you will need a specific security system such as a wireless camera system that comes with a WiFi NVR (Network Video Recorder) and WiFi surveillance cameras. </p>
									<p>The SHSS mobile application will need to be written in the appropriate languages for iOS and Android devices, as well as some prior knowledge on the ability to connect devices on a network together.</p>
									<p>The skills required are very feasible as there are many developers who develop apps on iOS and Android devices.</p>
									<p><b>Outcome</b></p>
									<p>If the project is successful it will allow users greater access to their security systems, in doing this it should assist in the decrease of break ins which will allow users to feel safer in their homes. Not only this, but it will assist in the improvement of current home security systems to better protect the users.</p>
